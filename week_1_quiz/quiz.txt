1. What is the value of a after the below code is executed?
  > a = 1
  > b = a
  > b = 3

Answer: 1

2. What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?

Answer: An array is automatically assigned a zero-based index, hashes allow for any object to be used as a key.

3. Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:
  > arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
  > [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq
  > [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq!

Answer:
  > [1, 2, 3, 3]
  > [1, 2, 3]
  > [1, 2, 3]

4. What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.

Answer: Map creates a new array with items that result from the code given in the block.  Select returns an array that
        contains the items that matched the boolean expression given in the block.  Map would be used for mutating your
        items, whereas select is useful for filtering them.

Examples:
  > # replace elements with their square
  > [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].map { |el| el**2 }

  > # get odd elements from array
  > [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].select { |el| el.odd? }

5. Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?

Answer: Put quotes around the key name and use the hash rocket instead of a colon

6. What is returned?

  > x = 1
  >   x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"

Answer: no, way!

7. What is x?

  > x = 1
  >   3.times do
  >     x += 1
  >   end
  >   puts x

Answer: 4

8. What is x?

  > 3.times do
  >     x += 1
  >   end
  >   puts x

Answer: Nil, there is no addition method for NilClass
